# AlphaLab - A Quantitative Equity Backtesting & Factor Analytics Platform

Overview

This project implements a modular, end-to-end Python workflow for systematic equity strategy research. It focuses on the S&P 500 universe and integrates:
	•	Factor-based Stock Screening: Value (P/E) and Momentum (6-month return) factors
	•	Automated Portfolio Construction: Equal-weight portfolios with scheduled rebalancing
	•	Historical Backtesting: Performance simulation and comparison against the S&P 500 benchmark
	•	Performance Analytics & Visualization: Cumulative return plots, risk and return statistics

This toolkit is designed for quant researchers, analysts, and developers to rapidly prototype and evaluate systematic investment strategies.

Features
	•	Data Ingestion: Fetch historical price and fundamental data using yfinance
	•	Train/Test Split: Prevents look-ahead bias by separating in-sample (train) and out-of-sample (test) periods
	•	Factor Computation: Automated calculation of P/E ratio and momentum scores for S&P 500 stocks
	•	Stock Selection: Composite ranking and top-N selection based on combined factor scores
	•	Portfolio Rebalancing: Quarterly (or user-defined) rebalancing with forward-filled weights
	•	Benchmark Comparison: Overlay strategy performance versus SPY (or ^GSPC) cumulative returns
	•	Performance Metrics: Total return, annualized return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio

⸻

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	pip or conda package manager
	•	Internet access for data download via yfinance

⸻

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/equity-backtest-platform.git
cd equity-backtest-platform


	2.	Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows


	3.	Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt



⸻

Usage
	1.	Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Equity_Backtest_Notebook.ipynb


	2.	Modify parameters at the top of the notebook:
	•	tickers slice (e.g., top 25 for demo or full S&P 500)
	•	Train/test split ratio
	•	Rebalance frequency (freq='QS', MS, etc.)
	3.	Run cells sequentially:
	1.	Setup & library imports
	2.	Download and preprocess data
	3.	Compute factors and select stocks
	4.	Backtest portfolio with rebalancing
	5.	Compute and plot performance metrics
	6.	Compare against benchmark

Performance Metrics Explained
	•	Total Return: Overall growth of $1 invested
	•	Annualized Return: Geometric average return per year
	•	Annualized Volatility: Standard deviation of daily returns scaled to yearly
	•	Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return (annualized return divided by volatility)

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:
	•	Add new factor models (quality, low volatility, etc.)
	•	Integrate ML-based signal generators
	•	Implement transaction cost analysis or slippage modeling
	•	Enhance visualization or reporting (dashboards, PDF export)
